# File Metrics for YAML

This document outlines the definition of file metrics for YAML.

### max_nesting_level

The max_nesting_level metric quantifies the deepest level of nesting within a YAML file.
It considers indentation and sequence annotation `-`.
Ex: we have `max_nesting_level = 0` for the YAML example `name: "yaml"` and empty files.

### lines_of_code

see [README.md](../README.md)
